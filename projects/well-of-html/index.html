    <h1>Pizzagate conspiracy theory</h1>
    
    <p><b>Pizzagate</b> is a debunked[2][3] conspiracy theory that emerged during the 
    2016 United States presidential election cycle. The theory, which went viral,
    claimed that John Podesta's emails, which were leaked by WikiLeaks, contained
    coded messages referring to human trafficking and connecting a number of 
    restaurants in the United States and members of the Democratic Party with a 
    fabricated child-sex ring. The false theory has been extensively discredited
    by a wide array of organizations, including the District of Columbia Police 
    Department..</p>
    
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>This conspiracy theory emerged near the end of the 2016 United States 
    presidential election cycle. On October 30, 2016, a white supremacist 
    Twitter account claimed the New York City Police Department, which was 
    searching emails found on Anthony Weiner's laptop as part of an 
    investigation into his sexting scandals, had discovered the existence of a 
    pedophilia ring linked to members of the Democratic Party.[4][5] Internet 
    users reading John Podesta's emails released by <strong>Wikileaks</strong> in early November
    2016 speculated that some words in Podesta's emails were code words for 
    pedophilia and human trafficking.[2][6] The theory also proposed that the 
    ring was a meeting ground for satanic ritual abuse.</p>
    
    <h3>Spread on social media</h3>
    <p>Users on Twitter and 4chan searched the leaked emails of <b>John Podesta</b> for
    food-related "code words" that supposedly revealed the existence of a sex 
    trafficking operation.[4] For example, The New York Times reported that the 
    phrase "cheese pizza" was thought by a poster to <b>4chan</b> to be a code word for
    child pornography since they had the same initials.[2] The allegations 
    spread to "the mainstream internet" following a post on the website Reddit 
    several days before the 2016 US presidential election.[9] The post, 
    meanwhile removed by the site, alleged the involvement of the Washington, D.C.,
    business Comet Ping Pong:

        <p><i>Everyone associated with the business is making semi-overt, 
        semi-tongue-in-cheek, and semi-sarcastic inferences towards sex with 
        minors. The artists that work for and with the business also generate 
        nothing but cultish imagery of disembodiment, blood, beheadings, sex, 
        and of course pizza.</i></p>
        
    <h4>Harassment of owners and employees</h4>
    <p>As Pizzagate spread, Comet Ping Pong received hundreds of threats from 
    the theory's believers.[27] The restaurant's owner, <em>James Alefantis</em>, told 
    <i>The New York Times</i>: "From this insane, fabricated conspiracy theory, we've 
    come under constant assault. I've done nothing for days but try to clean 
    this up and protect my staff and friends from being terrorized."

    Some adherents identified the Instagram account of Alefantis and pointed to
    some of the photos posted there as evidence of the conspiracy. Many of the 
    images shown were friends and family who had liked Comet Ping Pong's page on
    Facebook. In some cases, imagery was taken from unrelated websites and 
    claimed to be Alefantis' own.[3] The restaurant's owners and staff were 
    harassed, threatened on social media websites, and the owner received death
    threats.[14] The restaurant's Yelp page was locked by the operators of the 
    site citing reviews that were "motivated more by the news coverage itself 
    than the reviewer's personal consumer experience".</p>
    <h5>Comet Ping Pong shooting</h5>
    <p>On December 4, 2016, <em>Edgar Maddison Welch</em>, a 28-year-old Salisbury, 
    North Carolina man, fired three shots in the restaurant with an AR-15-style 
    rifle, striking walls, a desk, and a door.[39][40][41] Welch later told 
    police that he had planned to "self-investigate" the conspiracy theory. He 
    surrendered after he "found no evidence that underage children were being 
    harbored in the restaurant" and was arrested without incident.[43] No one 
    was injured.</p>

    <h6>Public opinion</h6>
    <p>A poll of voters conducted on December 17â€“20 by <i>The Economist/YouGov</i> 
    asked voters if they believed that, "Leaked e-mails from the Clinton 
    campaign talked about pedophilia and human trafficking - 'Pizzagate'." 
    The results showed that 97% of Clinton voters responded "true" while 3% 
    responded "not true"; and 46% of Trump voters responded "true" while 53% 
    responded "not true."</p>
